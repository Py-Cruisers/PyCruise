**Process:**

For optimal development, we had a staging branch (`test`) that acted as our temporary default branch to make sure we had full functionality before polishing everything into our main branch. We would checkout separate feature task branches with our work, make sure it works correctly, then push it into test. Only once we were confident that all our features were working correctly and in tune with one another did we push to `main`.  

Once the feature tasks were complete and working properly as well as merged onto our `test` branch, we would mark off another successful task complete on our trello board. Our **Trello** board helped keep us on track and organized in terms of priorities with our project.
